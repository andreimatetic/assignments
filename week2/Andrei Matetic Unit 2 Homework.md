# Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture

### Scenario  

Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work.  
- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones.
- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.
- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications.
- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals  
1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.  

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?  

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?  

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?  

### Step 2: Involve the Right People  
- Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.  

### Step 3: Training Plan  
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

- How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)  
    A: At a minimum annually and as part of new employee onboarding.  
- What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)  
- After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?
