    A: An incident is an event that affects the confidentially, integrity, or availability of an asset. The event has the potential to inappropriately disclose information. When actualized and the disclosure is **confirmed**, the incident is classified as a breach.

2.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors?  
    A: 69% outside actor  
       34% internal actor

3.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized criminal groups?   
    A: 39%

4.	What percentage of breaches were financially motivated?  
    A: 71%


5.	Define the following: 

- Denial of Service:

    A: An attack against the availability of a service/system. More often, many machines are used in concert (Distributed Denial of Service) to overwhelm the target. Can also take advantage of amplification attacks where a small request results in a large amount of data sent in reply to the victim.  
    
- Command and Control: 

    A: One or more servers in a botnet that receive data from from comprimised machines and sends instructions on what to do next.
    
- Backdoor:

    A: An access method that bypasses normal authentication. Sometimes put into code for _debug_ purposes and not removed from production. Could also be placed by malware and provide a remote shell into a system.
    
- Keylogger:
 
    A: Software that captures and records keystrokes entered by the user. Could also be a hardware device [keyboard <-> keylogger <-> host connection (e.g. USB)].

6.	The time from an attackerâ€™s first action to the initial compromise of an asset is typically measured in which one? Seconds, minutes, hours, days?  
    A: Minutes.  Unfortunately, discovery time lags much further behind.


7.	When it comes to phishing, which industry has the highest click rates?  
    A: Education (4.93%)
