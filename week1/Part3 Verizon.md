    A: One or more servers in a botnet that receive data from from comprimised machines and sends instructions on what to do next.
    
- Backdoor:

    A: An access method that bypasses normal authentication. Sometimes put into code for _debug_ purposes and not removed from production. Could also be placed by malware and provide a remote shell into a system.
    
- Keylogger:
 
    A: Software that captures and records keystrokes entered by the user. Could also be a hardware device [keyboard <-> keylogger <-> host connection (e.g. USB)].
