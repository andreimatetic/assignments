    A: CPU usage on the vicitm's device increases as the additional cycles are used to mine cryptocurrency.
    
11.	How does an exploit kit work? 

    A: When the victim arrives, scanning code in the kit determines which exploit (in its bundle) best matches the victim's configuration and then serves it. 
    
12.	What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in?

    A: Windows based computers
    
17.	What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers? 

    A: Not an attack per say but using operating system tools (e.g. ps exec, WMI, or powershell) to comprimise additional systems after obtaining initial access.  These tools are used for legitimate administrative purposes and can blend into network traffic.
    
18.	What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks?

    A: PS Exec, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), powershell, VB scripts
    
19.	What are zero-day exploits?

    A: Based on a zero-day vulnerability and the applicable vendor is unaware of the flaw's existence.
    
20.	By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline in 2018? 

    A: Down to 23% from 27% (in 2017). (4/27)*100  -> 14.8% decrease
    
21.	What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?

    A: 1. Dumping passwords from memory 
       2. brute-forcing access to network shares


22.	What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?

    A:  Rather than directly attacking a target, supply chain attack attacks compromise 3rd party services and vendors (e.g. stealing version control credentials, stealing valid certificate credentials to sign malicious code, compromising 3rd party libraries) as a means to reach the intended target.  Increased by 78% in 2018.


23.	What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations?

    A: These arrive through trusted channels or use legitimate tools for malicous purposes.
