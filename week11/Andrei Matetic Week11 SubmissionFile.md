## Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework

### Part 1: Review Questions

#### Security Control Types

The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set  of defense tactics.

1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?

    Answer: Physical

2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?

    Answer: Administrative

3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?

    Answer:  Technical

#### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators

1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?

    Answer: An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) works on a copy of network traffic (via a network tap or switch SPAN port). An IPS (Intrustion Prevention Systems) operates in-line with live traffic.  Intrusion Detecion is passive in that all they can do is alert.

2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?

   Answer:  Indicators of Attack are current and reference live activity. Indicators of Compromise are passive and reference something that happened in the past.

#### The Cyber Kill Chain

Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.

1. Stage 1: Reconnaissance - research, identification, and selection of targets. Trawl through social media, jobs postings, and forum posts for systems, application frameworks, and other attack vectors.

2. Stage 2: Weponization - Preparation of the attack.

3. Stage 3: Delivery - Get the weaponized payload created in stage 2 to the victims (e.g. phishing emails, drive-by web download, or that tempting USB flash drive)

4. Stage 4: Exploitation -- code from stage 2 is ran and exploits a vulnerability to gain initial access.

5. Stage 5: Installation - expand existing foothold. Install additional software, evelate privileges, move laterally and compromise additional systems

6. Stage 6: C2 (Command and Control) - compromised systems connect out to *control* waiting on instructions for what to do next

7. Stage 7: Action on Objectives  - Perform the intended action: exfiltrate data, encrypt data,  wipe systems, or launch an attack on someone else.


#### Snort Rule Analysis

Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:

Snort Rule #1

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer:  Alert (via message)  when a TCP packet is received from the external network for a system in $HOME_NET in the port range of 5800 through 5820. The SYN flag needs to be set (ignoring the CWR & ECE bits) [REF: `3.6.8 flags` http://manual-snort-org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node33.html#SECTION00468000000000000000]. The alert is triggered when there have been 5 instances over a 1 minute (60 second) interval for a particular source IP address.  Any **further instances** from the **same source IP address** in the **same interval** are ignored.

2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?

   Answer: Reconnaissance.

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: Reconnaissance. A SYN scan is being done looking for any VNC servers. If one is present the attacker can try connecting and seeing if a password is required to connect.

Snort Rule #2

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

   Answer: Alert (via message) on any external established connection on an HTTP port to any system in the HOME_NET that appears to be doing a non HTTP (web?) binary download other than a MS Windows Update. Check the contents for indicators of a Windows executable or DLL.

2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?

   Answer:  Delivery

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

   Answer: Policy violation. A user might be downloading non-approved software.

Snort Rule #3

- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.

    Answer:  
    ```bash
    alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET 4444 -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Potentially malicious remote shell"; sid:1004444; rev:1;)
    ```

### Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab

#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine

Log in using the following credentials:

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

#### Uninstall `ufw`

Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running. This will avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. This also ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.

- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt remove ufw
    ```

#### Enable and start `firewalld`

By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:

- Run the commands that enable and start `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    $ sudo service firewalld start
    ```

  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` remains active after each reboot.

#### Confirm that the service is running.

- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.

    ```bash
    $ sudo service firewalld status
    ```


#### List all firewall rules currently configured.

Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.

- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.

#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.

- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
    ```

- We can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.


#### Zone Views

- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
    ```

- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.

#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.

- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=Mail
    ```

#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:

- Run the commands that sets your `eth` interfaces to your zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public   --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Web      --change-interface=eth1
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Sales    --change-interface=eth2
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Mail     --change-interface=eth3
    ```

#### Add services to the active zones:

- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **web** zone, the **sales** zone, and the **mail** zone.

- Public:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=pop3
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=smtp
    ```

- Web:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=Web --add-service=http
    ```

- Sales

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=Sales --add-service=https
    ```

- Mail

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=Mail --add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=Mail --add-service=pop3
    ```

- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`?

#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.

- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.

     ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='10.208.56.23' drop"
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='135.95.103.76' drop"
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='76.34.169.118' drop"
    ```

    N.B. I opted for `drop` instead of `reject` as **drop** sends nothing back to the source ip address.

#### Make rules permanent then reload them:

It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.

- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

#### View active Zones

Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently **active** zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.

- Run the command that displays all zone services.

    ```bash
    # for ZONE in $(firewall-cmd --get-active-zones | grep -v interfaces); do echo $ZONE:; firewall-cmd --zone=$ZONE --list-services; done
    ```
![](images/Andrei Matetic Week11 SubmissionFile-c98cd4e5.png)

`--get-active-zones` does what it says, but includes a pesky *interfaces:* line. `grep -v interface` displays the lines that **don't** contain *interface* and so we have our list of zone. Plug each into the `--list-services` call for the services configured for the zone.

N.B. Okay, I ran this as root directly. I suppose I can wrapper it with `sudo bash -c "the above command"`. Formatting needs work but it does work and list the services configured for the active zones.

#### Block an IP address

- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='138.138.0.3' drop"
    ```

#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests

Harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp ehco` replies.

- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-icmp-block=echo-reply
    ```

#### Rule Check

Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.

- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=drop   --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Web    --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Sales  --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=Mail   --list-all
    ```

- Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.


Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.
