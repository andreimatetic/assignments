## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:  ` ls -l /etc/shadow`      
 `    -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow `    
    group shadow has read permission

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):  ` sudo chmod g-r /etc/shadow `  
   ```
    [sudo] password for sysadmin:  
    ls -l /etc/shadow  
    -rw------- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow
    ```
    
2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ` ls -l /etc/gshadow `    
    ` -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1076 May 14 15:31 /etc/gshadow `
group shadow has read permission

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): ` sudo chmod g-r /etc/gshadow `      
  ```
    ls -l /etc/shadow
    -rw------- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow
  ```

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: `ls -l /etc/group`  

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: `ls -l /etc/passwd`  

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):

### Step 2: Create User Accounts
```
N.B. I updated /etc/default/useradd with:  
SHELL=/bin/bash  
HOME=/home  (uncommented)    
```

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):  
```    
sudo useradd -m sam
sudo useradd -m joe
sudo useradd -m amy
sudo useradd -m sara
sudo useradd -m admin
```

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: ` sudo usermod -a -G sudo admin `    
```
grep sudo /etc/group
sudo:x:27:sysadmin,instructor,student,jack,admin 
```

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: `sudo addgroup engineers`
```
Adding group `engineers' (GID 1015) ...
Done. 
```

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):  
```
sudo usermod -a -G engineers sam
sudo usermod -a -G engineers joe
sudo usermod -a -G engineers amy
sudo usermod -a -G engineers sara
   
grep engineers /etc/group
engineers:x:1015:sam,joe,amy,sara
```

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder:  `sudo mkdir /home/engineers`  
 ```
 ls -l /home | grep engineers  
 drwxr-xr-x  2 root       root       4096 Jul 10 19:03 engineers
```

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:  `sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers/`   
```
ls -l /home/ | grep engineers
drwxr-xr-x  2 root       engineers  4096 Jul 10 19:03 engineers
```

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ` sudo apt install lynis `  
```
[sudo] password for sysadmin:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
lynis is already the newest version (2.6.2-1).
```

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:  `man lynis`  

3. Command to run an audit: `lynis audit system`  (can run with or without sudo )  

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output: `uploaded lynis.log to github with this file.`


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:  `sudo apt install chkrootkit`   

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: `man chkrootkit`  

3. Command to run expert mode: `sudo chkrootkit -x`

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
