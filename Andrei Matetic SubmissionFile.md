    - Command to inspect permissions:  ls -l /etc/shadow  
     -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow  
    group shadow has read permission

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):  
    sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo chmod g-r /etc/shadow  
    [sudo] password for sysadmin:
    sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
    -rw------- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow
    -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1076 May 14 15:31 /etc/gshadow
group shadow has read permission

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):
    sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo chmod g-r /etc/gshadow
    sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
    -rw------- 1 root shadow 2880 Jul  8 18:16 /etc/shadow


3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):

### Step 2: Create User Accounts
N.B. I updated /etc/default/useradd with:
SHELL=/bin/bash
HOME=/home  (uncommented)  

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group:

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder:

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo apt install lynis
[sudo] password for sysadmin:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
lynis is already the newest version (2.6.2-1).


2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: lynis audit system (can run with or without sudo )

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output: uploaded lynis.log to github with this file.


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
