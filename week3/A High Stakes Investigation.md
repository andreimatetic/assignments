# Andrei Matetic Player_Dealer_Correlation

## Correlating the Evidence  

Use grep to isolate all of the losses that occurred on March 10, 12, and 15th, and place those results in a file called Roulette_Losses.

\# some of the lines have 8 spaces (instead of a tab) between columns 2 & 3   
`grep \- 031*_win_loss_player_data | sed s/'        '/'\t'/g >> Roulette_Losses`

Preview the file Roulette_Losses and analyze the data and record:

- The times the losses occurred on each day.<br/>
`cat Roulette_Losses | cut -c1-4,27-28,36-37 --output-delimiter=' '  >> Loss_DateTimings `

- If there is a certain player that was playing during each of those times.
\# Pull out the players during the loses. Cleanup extraneous spaces

`awk -F'\t' '{print($3)}' Roulette_Losses | sed -e s/',[ ]*'/','/g -e s/'[ ]*$'//g -e s/'[ ]*,'/','/g >> Roulette_Losses_thePlayers`

do some frequency analysis</br>
okay, *overkill* in this case but my CDO wouldn't rest. **Mylie Schmidt** stuck out visually, but I was compelled to prove it. :)

## Dealer working during losses  
Missed that the instructions wanted these *scripted*. I manually grepped based on the `Loss_DateTimings`.  **Billy Jones** was the dealer in all these loses.

## Scripting Your Tasks
 1. Develop a shell script called `roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh` that can analyze the employee schedule to easily find the roulette dealer at a specific time.

 2. Test your script on the schedules to confirm it outputs the correct dealer at the time specified.

 **[Bonus]**  
 In case there is future fraud on the other Lucky Duck games, create a shell script called `roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh` that has the three following arguments:  
    - Specific time  
    - Specific date  
    - Casino game being played
